            <p>This page contains all the Quality and Assurance porcess undertaken while creating and building this webpages</p>
          </div>
          <div class="git-control-and-github">
            <h2>Git Control and Github and Branching</h2>
            <p>This web site is build keeping in mind the best practices of git version control. First a repository at <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NeilMoras/Http5201_Assignment_4">Github</a> created including
              a readme.md file giving a well defined name to highlight the purpose of the project.
              Once the repository is created, a new project folder is created on the IDE and the remote repository is cloned using the following command <code>git clone https://github.com/NeilMoras/Http5201_Assignment_4.git </code></p>
            <img class="example-img" src="/images/github_repo_link_img.png" alt="image of github repo link example" />
            <p>After the project is cloned, it is automatically linked to the repositories main branch by default. Since I am the only person pulling and pushing code from the remote repo, no branch is created and the project is pushed directly to
              the main branch after update. If the same project is contributed by one or more developer, it is a good practice to create a separate branch and then pushing your code to your new branch. once you push your code to the new branch, there
              is an option to create a pull request which will pull all the code from the main branch to your branch.You can tag your fellow developer working on the same repo to review your code. If there are any conflicts, it will be reflected and
              github will display the conflict and allow you to fix the conflict and once fixed,its best for your fellow developer to review it before merging it to the main branch. This method will help your code on your computer to be unaffected by
              any conflicts as your branch will handle the conflicts remotely and merge it. </p>
            <p> Even if I am the sole contributor working on the project, it is a good habit to always pull after making a commit as that will create a muscle memory</p>
            <p>Here are the following steps from cloning the repo and pushing your code to the repository</p>
            <ol>
              <li><code>git clone https://github.com/NeilMoras/Http5201_Assignment_4.git </code></li>
              <li><code>git status (provides information on the current branch and also any uncommited changes) </code></li>
              <li><code>git Add . (add all files) => git commit -m "first commit" OR git commit -am "first commit" </code></li>
              <li><code>git pull(fix and conflict after pull)</code></li>
              <li><code>git push</code></li>
            </ol>

          <div class="code-linting">
            <h2>Code Linting</h2>
            <p>Eslint was used inorder to linter the js files on this webpage. <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started">Eslint</a> was installed in the node_models as a dev dependency for
              this webpage using npm on terminal
              using <code>npm install eslint --save-dev</code></p>
            <p>Inside package.json file , there will be a rules section where you can add your rules as to what you will want eslint to look for and throw and error if it does not match the code rules deifned. This helped my js file to follow a good
              coding standards and maitain consistency in in terms of using Double quotes over single and the list can go on and on.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="code-standards">
            <h2>Code Standards</h2>
            <p>All the webpages follow various coding standards. BEM model has been implemented inorder to refine the naming convention of the ids and classes. classes are using hypens ('-') and id are using CamelCasing inorder to deferentiate</p>
            <p>SASS will be implemented in the future stages once I am more condifent using it, hence currently using vanilla CSS for styling . CSS, javascript and HTML code is formatted using a beautify package porvided by IDE in order to save tim,
              yet double checking in terms of whitespaces</p>
            <p>All codes comments are UPPERCASED inrder to maintain consistency and easy to read an well Highlighted .CSS is well organing,commeneted and placed in sections devided between comments. They are placed on order of the elements in
              sequence in order for easy readablilty and flow.</p>

          <div class="ad-hoc-testing">
            <h2>Ad Hoc Testing</h2>
            <p>Various ad hoc testing tools were used while building these web pages in order to maintain coding standards as well was building hight SEO(Search iengine Optimization).</p>
            <p>Follow are the tools used as part of Ad Hoc Testing</p>
